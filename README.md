22AIE214 Introduction to AI Robotics

This project involves building a **DIY robotic arm** using the Curious Arm kit, integrated with sensors to detect heat or flames and extinguish them with a water pump. The robotic arm uses **Arduino programming** to control 4 servo motors, allowing precise movement toward the heat source. A flame sensor or temperature sensor detects fire, while a relay-controlled water pump sprays water to extinguish it. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates concepts in **robotics, electronics, and automation**, making it ideal for learning while addressing practical challenges like fire safety.
