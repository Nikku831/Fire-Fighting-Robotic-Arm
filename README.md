Fire hazards remain a persistent threat in various industrial and commercial settings, particularly in environments where human access is limited or unsafe. Quick detection and localized suppression of fires are critical to minimizing damage and preventing the spread of flames. Traditional fire safety systems, such as sprinklers or manual extinguishers, often lack the precision and adaptability required for dynamic or high-risk zones. To address this issue, this project introduces a robotic fire response system built around a 3-DOF RRP (Revolute-Revolute-Prismatic) robotic arm. The robot is programmed to follow a predefined 3D trajectory while continuously scanning for fire points in its environment. Upon detecting a fire at any location along its path, the system automatically pauses, lowers its end-effector using the prismatic joint, and simulates spraying water directly onto the fire. Once the fire is addressed, the end-effector retracts, and the robot resumes its original trajectory without external intervention. This intelligent behavior is modeled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink and Simscape Multibody, allowing for precise visualization of the robot’s motion and real-time fire suppression actions. By combining autonomous sensing, decision-making, and targeted actuation, this project demonstrates how robotics can play a transformative role in enhancing fire safety systems—especially in environments like chemical plants, warehouses, and other high-risk industrial facilities.
